A fundraising webapp

So far this project is coming along well. The next big thing would be to increment the Select values and then
pass them to a database. My most recent contribution is a feature which automatically totals the amounts. What I seek to do next is to get the value of the select boxes, and then increment them on certain conditions. For example, Callbacks would increase if the select box is either "NH" or "CB".

Checklist:
*Increment SelectBoxes
*Clone Address name text field
*Pass values to the database
*A little more CSS couldn't hurt.
